Welcome!

This repository was created and used by Jacob Davis, Trenton Coppa, and Justin Huynh for AP Computer Science (2014-2015) and Robotics (2015-2016) at Deer Valley High School. This repository shows all of the projects we did in class as well as a few others we made for fun.

This repository is not meant to be a comprehensive solution to any projects done in class and is instead supposed to showcase our learning and progress. I would encourage anyone taking the class to use this repository as a resource if you are stuck or to learn about alternative solutions.
