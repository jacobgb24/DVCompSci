Welcome!

THIS IS NOT A PLACE TO BLATANTLY COPY CODE TO PASS A CLASS. TRY LEARNING SOMETHING INSTEAD

This repository should be used when you are stuck on a problem and can not find a solution. It can also be used to compare solutions after you have completed a project. You should never copy code directly. Doing this teaches you nothing and will not prepare you for any tests, especially the AP exam. I want to leave this repositroy up as a useful resource, but if it continues to be abused I will remove it.
